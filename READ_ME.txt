README:
Button prompt A corresponds to “Space” on PC and “B” corresponds to “ESC”

The player starts off in the world and on pressing ‘E’ can enter a band battle scene. 

The player can select an instrument (From guitar, bass, keytar or drums) using the left joystick or “W/S” and “Up/Down”

Then a corresponding move for each instrument with the same controls. 

Some moves are purely to gain additional crowd interest while some moves help enable special effects like disabling the next band’s turn, getting bonus moves or adding to the “Hype!” meter. 

The “Hype!” meter being full allows you to use an attack during player selection that doesn’t count as an additional move and allows you to play 2 songs together. 

Try to get better crowd interest and beat the enemy band.

Not playing correctly (Pressing random buttons or missing notes) reduces crown interest.

Missing notes will tune out the sound for the selected instrument temporarily.

Pressing random/incorrect buttons will distort the sound of the selected instrument and also reduce hype meter slightly.

The mini game is about precision and hitting the notes at the correct time to get OK, GOOD and PERFECT scores with corresponding crowd interest and scores. And also about using the correct moves in a strategic manner.

The note collectors are controlled by 1,2,3,4 on PC and A,B,X,Y on your controller.
To play the hyped move when the hype meter is full, press “ Left Cntrl” on PC and L2+ R2 on controller
